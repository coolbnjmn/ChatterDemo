                            Although these Terms form a proper legal contract—and inevitably read like a proper legal contract—the bulk of them are simply designed to ensure our users have fun. These Terms let us provide and continue to improve our Services, while at the same time ensuring that a few mean users don’t ruin the fun for everyone else. Your part in that is simple. Just use common sense: Keep meeting people and having awesome conversations with new friends, and please don’t do anything disrespectful.

                            Chatter is intended for people who are at least 13 years old. Persons under the age of 13 are prohibited from creating Chatter accounts. For certain features or functionality offered by us or others through the Services, users must be at least 18 years old. Those Services may be subject to separate terms from us or third parties that contain these further age requirements. If you are under 18 and use those Services, you may be violating the third party’s governing terms, which we deem a violation of these Terms as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You affirm that you are either at least 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, and to abide by and comply with these Terms. In addition, you affirm that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Services and do not have more than one Chatter account.

We may, without notice and in our sole discretion, terminate your right to use the Services, or any portion thereof, and block or prevent your future access to and use of the Services or any portion thereof.

                            Chatter makes it possible for you to Chat with celebrities that you would not otherwise have access to chat with. By clicking on the celebrity and agreeing to their fee, you agree to pay for every minute you chat with them, rounded up to the minute, so 6 minutes and 2 seconds, for example, counts as 7 minutes. Once you disconnect, you will stop being charged. You can always chat again. Please remember to have fun while maintaining a respectful conversation.

                            Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Chatter or the Chatter Parties be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages that result from (a) the use of, or inability to use, the Services; (b) the provision of the Services or any materials available therein; or (c) the conduct of other users of the Services, even if Chatter has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                            PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH CHATTER, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. </b>All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Chatter that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms set forth below (the "Arbitration Agreement"), except that you and Chatter are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Chatter, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Arbitration Rules.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules conflict with the Terms ("Arbitration Rules"). The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand U.S. dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is ten thousand U.S. dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration.</b> If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Authority of the Arbitrator.</b> The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Chatter, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Chatter. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Waiver of Jury Trial.</b> YOU AND CHATTER HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Chatter in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND CHATTER WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. </b>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, in the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead all claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in Los Angeles County, California. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Confidentiality.</b> No part of the procedures shall be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Right to Waive.</b> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Small Claims Court.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Chatter may bring an individual action in small claims court. 
</li>
                            <li><b>Courts.</b> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Los Angeles County, California, for such purpose. 
</li>   
                            <li><b>Survival.</b> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Chatter. </li>

                            A lawsuit, if any, by you or Chatter against the other will occur in state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California. You and Chatter agree that the jurisdiction and venue of these courts is exclusive.

                            These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete agreement between you and Chatter.

We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services and delete your Chatter account.

                            For you to create a basic Chatter account, we need to collect a few important details about you: a unique username you’d like to go by, a password, an email address we can contact you at, a phone number, and your age or date of birth. For additional Services beyond the basic Chatter account, we may ask you for additional information. We collect a debit or credit card number or an image of the card, its associated account information, and any other security-related information for payment for Chats. We want you, though, to be in control of your information, so we let you update or correct most of the basic Chatter account information by editing your account settings within Chatter. You may delink your payment card information in the Chatter settings. And while we hope you’ll remain a lifelong Chatterer, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, you may do so within the app at any time; but keep in mind that we may retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law. For more information about how we store and delete the messages you send or receive through Chatter, please read the “Message Deletion” section a little farther down.

We also collect certain device information that will help us diagnose problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services. So, for example, if we detect a crash or other problematic event, we may collect the list of apps on your device and other information about your device’s performance at the time of the event for troubleshooting purposes. 
</li>
                             <li><b>Device Phonebook and Photos.</b> Because Chatter is all about communicating with friends, we may—with your consent—collect information from your device’s phonebook and photos. We do this so that we can connect you to your friends quickly and intuitively, enhance the Services with additional functionality, and for any other purpose described in this privacy policy. You can always revoke your consent to our ongoing ability to collect information from your device’s phonebook and photos by changing the settings on your device if your device offers that option, or by simply deleting our app from your device (though we hope you’ll never do that). 
</li>
                              <li><b>Location Information.</b> With your consent, we collect your device location so that you can use our location-based features, such as message filters and Our Stories, and for any other purpose described in this privacy policy. As with your phonebook and photos, you can always revoke your consent by changing the settings or preferences on your device. If you do so, certain features of the Services will no longer function. And, of course, you can revoke your consent by deleting Chatter from your device. 
</li>
                               <li><b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</b> Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that store information about your use of the Services, which can, among other things, help us see which areas and features of the Services are popular and let us count visits. Web beacons are small pieces of software on a webpage or email that help us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how third parties use such technologies on our Services, be sure to read the “Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others” section of our privacy policy.

We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with the information we collect through Chatter.

                        <p>
                            What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of Services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Provide and deliver the products, services, and functionality that you request, process transactions, and send you related information;
</li>
                        <li>Communicate with you. That means just what it says; we may send you marketing communications on behalf of us or other companies; respond to your comments and questions; provide customer service; and send you technical notices, security alerts, and other informational messages; 
</li>
                        <li>Monitor and analyze trends and usage;
</li>
                        <li>Develop, improve, and refine products, services, and functionality;
</li>
                        <li>Personalize the Services by providing advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles or interests. For instance, when you set up an account we may pre-populate certain account information based on the information we collect about you from other users;
</li>
                        <li>Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; and
</li>
                        <li>Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.

                        <p>
                            Chatter is based in the United States. Although we welcome Chatterers from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our Services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries. We want you to know this because the laws of the United States and those of other countries where your information is processed might not be as comprehensive or protective as laws in the country where you live. And while you’re in another country, know that your information may be made available to government or law enforcement requests. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            How We Share Information
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Here’s the type of information we may share about you with others and how we do so: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you send a message, your recipients will see your username and, of course, whatever your message says or shows (whether that’s a photo, video, text, or transaction). When you view content that another Chatter user has sent you, we will let the sender know that you saw it, and if we detect that you captured a screenshot of the message, we will try to let the sender know that. But you’re always able to tell us whether you’d like to receive Chatter only from users you have added to your friends list or whether you’d prefer to receive Chatter from all Chatterers. If you have any questions about how to do that, click here for some helpful tips. And if you ever want to delete users from your friends list, block specific users, or control who can view your Stories, we let you do that as well through various settings. For more information on how to manage who can send you Chatter, read this helpful article. 
</li>
                            <li>When you use video chat, the recipient will see your live video and the recipient’s device will receive some technical information about your device to facilitate the connection. You’ll learn even more about how to use video chat and manage this feature by checking out this help article.
</li>
                            <li>When you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook. For instance, when you use Find Friends, we may share your username and name with other users who use Find Friends and have your phone number in their device phonebook. In these cases, we will not display your phone number to these users, but we will share the fact that your username and name are associated with your phone number.
</li>
                            <li>When other users view your profile, they will be able to view profile information, including your username, “score” (the total number of messages you have sent and received), a list of the friends you exchange messages with the most (your “Best Friends” list), and, depending on your settings, your name. Similarly, your username may appear in the Best Friends lists of others.
</li>
                            <li>If another user tries to interact with you through a feature that you’re unable to use because you’re too young—say, for instance, you don’t meet the 18+ age requirement for Chatter—we may tell the user that you’re ineligible to use the feature, so that the user isn’t left wondering why you never responded.
</li>
                            <li>We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf.
</li>
                            <li>With respect to jointly offered Services or functionality or services offered separately by other companies through our Services, we may share information about you with business partners to provide the Services and functionality you request and to communicate with you about those Services;
</li>
                            <li>We may share information about you in response to legal process or a request for information if we believe disclosure is consistent with, or required by, any applicable law, rule, or regulation; to investigate or remedy potential violations of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
</li>
                            <li>We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction, or as otherwise provided in this privacy policy.
</li>
                        </ul>
